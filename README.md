# tensor_decompositoin_comparison

* The script in jupyter notebook implemented the idea of comparing Euclidean distance of different videos and get the distribution of people flow for surviliance video monitoring
* The script in jupyter notebook implemented the conventional RPCA algorithms for static background and moving foreground, which is looking of optimization on existing ones 
* The script could be ran on high performance server and machine instead of standalone local machine due to the high throughput required
* Commented part of code and run it step by step on demand, due to the decomposition will enlarge the storage of original tensor,as the video tensor require memeory storage
